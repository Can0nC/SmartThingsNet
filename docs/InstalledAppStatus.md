# Org.OpenAPITools.Model.InstalledAppStatus
Denotes the current state of an install.  'PENDING' is used during active modification to the install's config prior to 'AUTHORIZATION'. A status of 'AUTHORIZED' means the install's permissions have been authorized by the consumer. Installed Apps in 'AUTHORIZED' state are fully installed and usable by the SmartThings platform.  A status of 'REVOKED' means the install's permissions have been revoked.  A status of 'DISABLED' means a previously 'AUTHORIZED' Installed App will not execute.
