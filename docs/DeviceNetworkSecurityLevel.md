# Org.OpenAPITools.Model.DeviceNetworkSecurityLevel
For hub-connected devices on protocols with multiple security levels, the security level the device was added with. Values ZWAVE_S2_FAILED, ZWAVE_S0_FAILED, ZWAVE_S2_DOWNGRADE, and ZWAVE_S0_DOWNGRADE should be treated as failures and prompt the user to remove and re-add the device. Other Z-Wave values are success cases.
